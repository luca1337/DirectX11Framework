# DirectX11Framework
A DirectX 11 component-based Engine entirely written in C++

This Engine only works for Win32 platforms and it's not written to work on xbox platform, for that i have another version of it that works on both pc and xbox, the main reason that brought me to have two different version it's because the Win32 version has more flexibility with the code so i can write and test things that i can port on xbox too and less struggle with this API.

Physx engine:

-Yes i'm using physx because it's awesome and not really hard integrate it.

Rendering Pipeline:

-D3D11 as mentioned above supporting 11.0 and 11.1 DirectX versions.

Other Tools:

- DirectXTK the toolkit helper that wraps and ease many DirectX functions like XMINTRINSIC functions, other like keyboard events to handle input, SpriteBatch for sprite2D rendering and so on.. -> https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK. this is an awesome wrapper i love it
